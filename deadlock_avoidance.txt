Deadlock Avoidance

1. Use try_lock() with a timeout
    - Instead of blocking lock()
    - May result in livelock

2. Use std::lock()
    - Lock both mutexes in a single operation

3. Use hierarchical ordering
    - Lock lower-numbered mutexes first

Deadlock Avoidance Guidelines
1. Avoid waiting for a thread while holding a lock
    - other thread may need the lock to proceed
2. Try to avoid waiting for other threads
    - other thread may be waiting for your thread
3. Try to avoid nested locks
    - if your thread already holds a lock, do not acquire another operation
    - if you need mulitple locks, acquire them in a single operation
4. Avoid calling functions within a critical section
    - Unless you are certain the function does not try to block
